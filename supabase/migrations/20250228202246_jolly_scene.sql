  # Fix Storage Bucket Issue

  1. Changes
    - Add a note about creating the storage bucket manually in Supabase
  
  2. Security
    - Ensure proper bucket policies are set up
*/

-- This migration is a reminder to create the storage bucket manually in Supabase
-- Since SQL migrations cannot create storage buckets, you need to:
--
-- 1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
-- 2. Navigate to Storage
-- 3. Click "Create a new bucket"
-- 4. Name it "playground-images"
-- 5. Make it public (or set appropriate RLS policies)
--
-- Then add the following policies to the bucket:
--
-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload files
-- - Name: "Allow authenticated uploads"
-- - Allowed operation: INSERT
-- - Target roles: authenticated
-- - Policy definition: true
--
-- Policy 2: Allow public access to read files
-- - Name: "Allow public read access"
-- - Allowed operation: SELECT
-- - Target roles: anon, authenticated
-- - Policy definition: true

-- This SQL statement does nothing but serves as documentation
